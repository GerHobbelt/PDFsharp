# PDFSharp for .NET Standard

This project is a fork of https://github.com/YetaWF/PDFsharp-.netcoreapp2.0, which is itself a fork of the original [PdfSharp](https://github.com/empira/PDFsharp).
It is the only fork of PdfSharp I could find that supports .NET Standard and does everything I needed without errors.

## Installation
